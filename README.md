# ruby-pitfalls

An evolving list of language pitfalls when writing ruby code.


## Calling a super method may lose information

If a subclass defines a method with the same name but different signature - less arguments - than the base class, calling "super" to invoke the base class' method will not pass the missing argument's information.


## {} and do..end are not equivalent

Curly braces {} bind more tightly than do..end, so they are not syntactically equivalent. See http://stackoverflow.com/a/5587399/562906.

## Space between method name and parenthesis

method (arg) is not the same as method(arg)

## Many built-in objects are mutable

For example, nil:
  
  > def nil.+足(x)
  .. return 59+x
  .. end
  => nil
  > nil + 3
  => 62
  > class Shoko足
  .. def how
  .... return @x
  .... end
  .. end
  => nil
  > Shoko.new.足how
  => nil
  > Shoko.new.足how + 3
  => 62
